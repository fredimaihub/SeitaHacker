Small college project Hacker Sect themed.
It simulates a terminal where the user types an username which is saved in a file called "log.txt" whose will register
every command, unless the user inputs "removeLog()" in the terminal command line, which exludes all data saved in the file.

Then the screen changes to the terminal, in which the user inputs commands like "getNome()" to get a random name in the
execution database of people that the system creates.
The system interprets the Java commands the user inputs and executes it simulating the "hacking" system to get and set people
data and manage bank accounts.
